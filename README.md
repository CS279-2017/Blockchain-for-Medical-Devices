# Blockchain Technology for Medical Uses
Spring 2017 Blockchain Healthcare application

Zach Barton, Wendy Yu, Dillon Rolnick, Raymond Carter

For this project, we will be using the Ethereum blockchain platform, leveraging the smart contract capabilities to complete file/data transfers from patient to physician and vice versa. The Ethereum geth platform, which runs on the Go programming language, seems to be the most used and most supported, so we will begin with learning Go and geth.

For the webapp, we will be using Node.js for the backend, Express.js for the middleware, MongoDB for the database, and Bootstrap for the UI.
